# Best Practices
Tips to guarantee a good user experience for your extensions.

General
Handle errors
Network requests can fail, permissions to files can be missingâ€¦ More generally, errors happen. By default, we handle every unhandled exception or unresolved Promise and show error screens. However, you should handle the "expected" error cases for your command. You should aim not to disrupt the user's flow just because something went wrong. For example, if a network request fails but you can read the cache, show the cache. A user might not need the fresh data straight away. In most cases, it's best to show a Toast with information about the error.

Here is an example of how to show a toast for an error:

Copy
import { Detail, showToast, Toast } from "@raycast/api";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Command() {
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error>();

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setError(new Error("Booom ðŸ’¥"));
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (error) {
      showToast({
        style: Toast.Style.Failure,
        title: "Something went wrong",
        message: error.message,
      });
    }
  }, [error]);

  return <Detail markdown="Example for proper error handling" />;
}
Handle runtime dependencies
Ideally, your extension doesn't depend on any runtime dependencies. In reality, sometimes locally installed apps or CLIs are required to perform functionality. Here are a few tips to guarantee a good user experience:

If a command requires a runtime dependency to run (e.g. an app that needs to be installed by the user), show a helpful message.

If your extension is tightly coupled to an app, f.e. searching tabs in Safari or using AppleScript to control Spotify, checks don't always have to be strict because users most likely don't install the extension without having the dependency installed locally.

If only some functionality of your extension requires the runtime dependency, consider making this functionality only available if the dependency is installed. Typically, this is the best case for actions, e.g. to open a URL in the desktop app instead of the browser.

Show loading indicator
When commands need to load big data sets, it's best to inform the user about this. To keep your command snappy, it's important to render a React component as quickly as possible.

You can start with an empty list or a static form and then load the data to fill the view. To make the user aware of the loading process, you can use the isLoading prop on all top-level components, e.g. <Detail>, <Form>, <Grid>, or <List>.

Here is an example to show the loading indicator in a list:

Copy
import { List } from "@raycast/api";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Command() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<string[]>();

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setItems(["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]);
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <List isLoading={items === undefined}>
      {items?.map((item, index) => (
        <List.Item key={index} title={item} />
      ))}
    </List>
  );
}
Forms
Use Forms Validation
Before submitting data, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format.

In Raycast, validation can be fully controlled from the API. To keep the same behavior as we have natively, the proper way of usage is to validate a value in the onBlur callback, update the error of the item and keep track of updates with the onChange callback to drop the error value. The useForm utils hook nicely wraps this behaviour and is the recommended way to do deal with validations.


Keep in mind that if the Form has any errors, the Action.SubmitForm onSubmit callback won't be triggered.

FormValidationWithUtils.tsx
FormValidationWithoutUtils.tsx
Copy
import { Action, ActionPanel, Form, showToast, Toast } from "@raycast/api";
import { useForm, FormValidation } from "@raycast/utils";

interface SignUpFormValues {
  name: string;
  password: string;
}

export default function Command() {
  const { handleSubmit, itemProps } = useForm<SignUpFormValues>({
    onSubmit(values) {
      showToast({
        style: Toast.Style.Success,
        title: "Yay!",
        message: `${values.name} account created`,
      });
    },
    validation: {
      name: FormValidation.Required,
      password: (value) => {
        if (value && value.length < 8) {
          return "Password must be at least 8 symbols";
        } else if (!value) {
          return "The item is required";
        }
      },
    },
  });
  return (
    <Form
      actions={
        <ActionPanel>
          <Action.SubmitForm title="Submit" onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
        </ActionPanel>
      }
    >
      <Form.TextField title="Full Name" placeholder="Tim Cook" {...itemProps.name} />
      <Form.PasswordField title="New Password" {...itemProps.password} />
    </Form>
  );
}
