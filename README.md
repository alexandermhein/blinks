## Notion Integration

This extension stores Blinks in a single Notion database with full create, read, update, and delete support.

### 1) Create a Notion Integration

- In Notion, go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Develop your own integrations
- Create a new Internal Integration and copy the token (`secret_...`)

### 2) Create a Database

Create a database (Table view recommended) and add these properties:

- Title (title)
- Type (select) with options: Thought, Reminder, Bookmark, Quote
- Context (rich text) ‚Äî optional freeform description
- URL (url) ‚Äî optional source link
- Author (rich text) ‚Äî used for Quotes
- Reminder Date (date)
- Is Completed (checkbox)
- Completed At (date)

Share the database with your integration (Share ‚Üí Invite ‚Üí Select your integration).

### 3) Configure Raycast Preferences

In Raycast ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Blinks, set:

- Notion API Token: Your `secret_...` token
- Notion Database ID: The database ID (from the URL)

Now all Blinks will be stored in this Notion database.

### Troubleshooting

- Invalid preferences: Ensure both Notion API Token and Database ID are set in Raycast.
- Wrong property names: Property names must match exactly (e.g., "Context", not "Description").
- Missing permissions: Share the database with your integration in Notion.
- API limits: Heavy usage may hit Notion rate limits; try again shortly.
